# Bib Styles with Special Field Supporting

This repository buffers certain "commonly" used bib styles that have certain special fields supported. 

## How to Use 

Simply copy the `.bst` file to the root directory of your project, and then add the following line in your root LaTeX file.

```TeX
\bibliographystyle{the-bst-filename-without-extension}
```

Or, copy all the `.bst` to the bst folder of your LaTeX toolkit.
